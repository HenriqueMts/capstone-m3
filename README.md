**AdoPet** Was developed to connect peoples hos want to adopt a pet with hos need's a new home for the pets.

## Issues to be solved

Adopet aims to help build a bridge between different NGOs and pet lovers.

World Health Organization estimate's just in Brazil there are more than 30 millions homeless animals ho's need health care.

The biggest dificulty is tri finding someone who's resposible and takes care of the animal, our plataform gives the user informations that are crucial to find the best person's possible.

is important to remind our platform just connect NGOs with people, we don't responsible to deliver the animal.
